# 📘 Day 2 – HTML Recap & JavaScript Execution Methods
📅 Date: 28th May 2025  
🏢 Internship: MERN Full Stack @ Blackbucks

## ✅ Topics Covered:

### 1. **HTML Basics**
- Understood the **structure of an HTML document**:
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  - `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`
- Learned about commonly used **HTML tags**:
  - Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
  - Paragraphs (`<p>`)
  - Links (`<a>`)
  - Images (`<img>`)
  - Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
  - Forms and Inputs (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<button>`)
- Explored **attributes** like `href`, `src`, `alt`, `type`, `value`, etc.

### 2. **JavaScript Introduction & Methods to Use It**

#### ✅ Method 1: Using **Browser Console (Inspect Element)**
- Opened DevTools (`Right click > Inspect > Console`)
- Typed JavaScript directly into the console for instant execution
- Great for testing and debugging small pieces of code quickly

#### ✅ Method 2: Using an **External JavaScript File**
- Wrote JavaScript in a separate file (`script.js`)
- Linked the file to HTML using:
  ```html
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  ```
- Ensures code is organized and reusable

#### ✅ Method 3: Using **Inline or Internal Script in HTML**
- **Inline Script Example:**
  ```html
  <button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click Me</button>
  ```
- **Internal Script Example:**
  ```html
  <script>
    console.log("Hello from internal script!");
  </script>
  ```
- Usually placed inside the `<head>` or just before `</body>`

## 📝 Summary:
> Today I built foundational knowledge in HTML and learned three ways to use JavaScript — via browser console, external JS files, and inline/internal scripts. These methods are essential for web development and will help me as I move into dynamic web interactivity.
