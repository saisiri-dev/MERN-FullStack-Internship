# 🚀 MERN Full-Stack Development Internship @ Blackbucks

## 📖 Internship Overview

This repository serves as a complete journal of my learning journey during the **MERN Stack Full-Stack Web Development Internship** offered by **Blackbucks**. Over the course of this internship, I will be engaging in hands-on learning, real-world assignments, and projects that aim to enhance my knowledge and skills in full-stack web development using the MERN technology stack — **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**.

The repository is structured to reflect daily progress, with each day or module containing relevant source code, assignments, explanations, and reflections. The internship not only emphasizes coding skills but also instills software engineering practices like version control, documentation, debugging, and deployment workflows.
